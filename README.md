# Methods in Psycholinguistics (LINGUIST 245)

This repository serves to store the experiments, data, analyses, and documentation for experiments (originals and replications) run as part of the class. Each student's project will live in its own project folder.

## Guidelines for creating your project folder

1. Name your project folder intuitively. For example, if I want to replicate Bott & Noveck 2004 on scalar implicatures, I may call my folder *scalar_implicature_bn*. 

2. Include a README.md file at the top level of your project folder. The README should contain a short paragraph about your project.

3. Your project folder should contain the following sub-folders:

	- experiment
	- data
	- results
	- docs

4. Each of the sub-folders should contain a README.md file with a (few) sentence(s) on what it contains.
