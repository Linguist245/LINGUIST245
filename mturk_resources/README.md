# Mechanical Turk Resources

We will use [Submiterator](https://github.com/erindb/Submiterator) to link our experiments to Mechanical Turk, retrieve results from Mechanical Turk, and reformat the results to analyze in R. Follow the instructions [here](https://github.com/erindb/Submiterator) for installation instructions.

## Things to keep in mind

- You need to prepay for MTurk HITs. Remember there's a 20% Amazon fee (40% if you run more than 9 people per HIT). Use Michael Henry Tessler's [batch submiterator](https://github.com/mhtess/submiterator-batch) script for running more than 9 people but avoiding the extra fee.
